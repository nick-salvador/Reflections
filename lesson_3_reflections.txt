When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is beneficial when you are working across multiple machines or collaborating with other developers who need to access your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This ensures that you aren't constantly working with new code that is being uploaded by potential collaborators. If you are working on one particular feature and a colleague is making edits to something else, it makes sense to wait to pull the changes that he pushed only when you are finished making your changes as well.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is an evolutionary path of your file/project. You can use multiple branches to change your project in different ways while keeping things separate. A clone is a copy of a GitHub repository that exists on your local machine. A fork is similar, the difference being that a fork is a generated by GitHub, gets copied directly to your GitHub account, and links back to the original repository.
